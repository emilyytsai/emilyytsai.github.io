### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 3 was one of my favorite labs because I often wondered about how guessing games, such as the hilo game we programed, were made. From this lab, I started to learn how to write and use if-statements for the first time. I am glad I got to program a hilo game and that I now know how guessing games like these work.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 3 was one of my favorite labs because I got to learn how to program a game of Blackjack. I am happy that I learned how to make a Blackjack game because I used to always play online Blackjack games against my friends, and now I know how these games work. From this lab, I learned how to use vectors and else-if statements.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I got to learn how to program another guessing game. I found this lab to be very interesting since it helped answer more questions I had about how guessing games worked. From this lab, I learned how to write and use while loops.
